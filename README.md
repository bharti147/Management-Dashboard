# Management Dashboard

## Overview

This project is a **Management Dashboard** designed to offer a seamless interface for managing categories and widgets dynamically. Built with React and Tailwind CSS, the dashboard allows users to interact with various widgets, such as bar graphs, pie charts, and tables, while providing the flexibility to add and remove widgets or categories as needed.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: The dashboard is fully responsive and adapts to different screen sizes for a consistent user experience across devices.
- **Category and Widget Management**: Users can easily add new categories and widgets through a user-friendly interface. Although the initial data is fetched from a JSON file, updates are managed using Redux Toolkit and localStorage instead of updating the JSON file.
- **Redux Toolkit**: Used for efficient state management, ensuring smooth and scalable handling of categories and widgets.
- **LocalStorage Integration**: Data persistence is managed via localStorage, allowing dynamic changes to be saved across sessions.
